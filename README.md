# Open-Source-Contributions
This is a repository for our upcoming Intro To Git Workshop!

This is a simple calculator that has approximately 20 errors so each attendee can fix an error on their own and learn the process of contributing to open-source software in practice.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DIRECTIONS:

Pick a single error to fix using the directions we explained in the workshop. If you need to go back and look at our instructions again, feel free to check the slideshow on our Facebook page or ask either Nate or Pranay for any help. We ask that this be done by Friday night so we can be sure everyone is ready to start contributing to open-source.
